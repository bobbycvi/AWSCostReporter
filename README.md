# AWSCostReporter
AWSCostReporter is a Python script that automates the process of fetching cost data from AWS Cost Explorer, applying filters, exporting the data to a CSV file, and sending the file via email. It's designed to be user-friendly and is particularly useful for keeping track of AWS costs over a period of three months.
